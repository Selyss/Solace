# Inspiration
I used [this guide](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) as a starting point, and am expanding off it. This project gave me a very simple program that displays text, allows for input, and moves the cursor. I hope to expand this project into something (fairly) useable that could possibly help someone somewhere if they are crazy enough to use it.
